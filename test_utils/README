To run redmine behind nginx proxy with SSL use:


http {
	map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
		default upgrade;
		'' close;
	}
}

in the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

and copy redmine.nginx.conf to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled



You will also need to edit config/environment.rb:

Change:

Rails.application.initialize!

with:

RedmineApp::Application.routes.default_scope = { :path => '/redmine/, :shallow_path => '/redmine' }
RedmineApp::Application.initialize!
Redmine::Utils::relative_url_root = "/redmine"
